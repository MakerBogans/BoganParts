# Solid Skirts

![Solid Skirts](cad_preview.png)

I really liked the look of Ryan's solid skirts (here: https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/96714-voron-rm-front-rear-skirt-mod) but I'm using Eddie's Z tensioner mod (here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/edwardyeeks/V2.4_z_drive_motor_tensioner_mod). No problem - I've merged the two to create some solid skirts of my own.

## Status

I've fitted a set to my V2.4 350 mm, and it works well!

If I were to print them again, I'd probably drop 0.5 mm of clearance between the LCD and the skirts just to close up the gap.

## How to

Really simple. Print with Voron settings and use 4x M3x8 SHS and 4x M3 T-nuts.
